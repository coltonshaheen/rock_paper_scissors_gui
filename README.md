# rock_paper_scissors_gui

Rock, paper, scissors game w/ GUI. First to five wins the game.

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/rock-paper-scissors).

Learned a lot about DOM manipulation. I basically had to destroy my 'for' loops and restructure most of my code. Lots of fun!
